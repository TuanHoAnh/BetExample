# User guide
userguide.general.header=Group Management Example
userguide.general.guide=<p>Team A is working on project P. In occasion of soccer tournament C, they want to create friendly bets between team member. The rule is anybody can join, but after they join, they have to bet on every designated match. They will automatically lose if no bet was placed on any match. If you lose the bet, you lose money. If you win the bet, however, you WON'T lose any money. The total losing money will be calculated by NgayThoBet system and the team can use it for team building activities.</p><p>For example: Bet amount for matches is as following: 48 x 6k (Group stage) + 8 x 8k (1/16 round) + 4 x 10k (1/4 round) + 3 x 14k (Semi-final + third place playoff) + 20k (Final)=454k</p><p>To make things more interesting, there will be 100k price for those who lost the least matches, 50k for those who lost the most.</p><p>NgayThoBet’s owner will create a betting group for team A. One or some people will be chosen as administrator(s), these people will be added by product’s owner. The administrators can add/delete users, add/edit/delete matches. A couple days before a match starts, administrator will update odds ratio base on trusted sites (e.g. http://www.bongda.com.vn/dudoan/World_Cup_2010.aspx). After odds ratio is updated, administrator will allow users to bet on that match. When the match starts, the system will automatically disable betting function for that match. After they match ends, administrator will input the match’s final result.</p><p>Lost money statistic board of each people will be public for all team members. Team can use that money to create recreation events (e.g. one small party after group stage and one after Final match). Summary function will do the calculation.</p><p>There are multiple groups participating simultaneously and no one will know about others (except product owner). Therefore, match list can be populated for future groups since product owner can copy matches from one group to another.</p>
